Trust Graph MVP: Zero-instrumentation agent lineage with OpenTelemetry                                                                                                                          
   
  Implement a complete trust graph system that captures "who acted on behalf                                                                                                                      
  of whom" in multi-agent systems without instrumenting application code.

  Architecture:
  - Envoy ingress gateway injects trust headers at entry point
  - Envoy sidecars on each agent emit spans with trust.* attributes
  - OpenTelemetry Collector receives traces and exports to Jaeger
  - Lineage service reconstructs trust chains from distributed traces

  Agents:
  - chat-agent: Router/orchestrator with keyword-based multi-agent dispatch
  - summary-agent: Aggregates salary data (calls read-agent)
  - read-agent: Reads employee data from database
  - sales-agent: Queries sales data linked to employees

  Trust attributes captured:
  - trust.principal_id: Original user/caller identity
  - trust.run_id: Request correlation across agents
  - trust.hop_kind: principal_to_agent | agent_to_agent | agent_to_resource
  - trust.source/target: Caller and callee identities

  Features:
  - A2A agent cards (JSON metadata) describing capabilities
  - /lineage/{run_id} for full debug trace view
  - /lineage/{run_id}/trust for deduplicated trust graph
  - Multi-hop lineage: Principal -> Agent -> Agent -> Resource

  Demonstrates accountability and provenance in agent-based systems
  using only infrastructure components (Envoy, OTel, Jaeger, K8s).
